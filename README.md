## Game sales over time
This visualization shows the game sales through years. The bars are stacked so it can be easy to visualize global sales and the user can also view the data for a single region (Europe, North America, Japan or Rest of the World). It is also possible to view the sales as a percentage for a given year, making it easier to identify the region with most sales for that year.
